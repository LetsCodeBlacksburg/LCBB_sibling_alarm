This letscodeblacksburg.org project for our "Sibling Detector Alarm", stepping students through how to integrate the PIR sensor recipe, the LCD/button shield recipe and the speaker/buzzer recipe to "mix & bake" a motion activated alarm system. See code for hardware/software requirements.

* [LCBB_Sibling_Alarm.pdf](LCBB_Sibling_Alarm.pdf)
This is the Sibling Detector Alarm Workshop PDF Handout (aka build doc) that contains step by step build directions and references to cookbook recipes, etc.	

* [PIR_LCD_keypad_sibling_alarm](PIR_LCD_keypad_sibling_alarm)
This is the completed code.

This workshop is composed of several individual example recipe code snippets for the PIR sensor and LCD-key shield, from our Arduino cookbook here:

* PIR Motion Sensor - https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/arduino-recipes/tree/master/PIR_sensor_blink
* LCD-keypad Shield - https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/arduino-recipes/tree/master/shields/lcd_keypad
* Master LCBB Cookbook - https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/arduino-recipes/blob/master/LCBB_Arduino_Cookbook.pdf
